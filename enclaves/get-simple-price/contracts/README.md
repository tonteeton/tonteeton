# get-simple-price contract

## Motivation

To provide smart contracts with up-to-date TON market prices.


## Summary

Prices are obtained from [CoinGecko](https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/simple-price).

The enclave contract operates as follows:

- **Client Interaction**: Client contracts interact with the enclave using the [`OraclePriceRequest`](#oraclepricerequest) message to request specific asset prices (currently only TON is supported, ticker `0x72716023`).

- **Response Mechanism**:
  - **[`OraclePriceResponse`](#oraclepriceresponse)**: If the enclave has up-to-date data for the requested asset, it responds with the corresponding price details.
  - **[`OraclePriceScheduledResponse`](#oraclepricescheduledresponse)**: If the enclave doesn't have up-to-date data but acknowledges the request, it responds with details about the scheduled response. Clients can repeat the request later to obtain updated information.
  - **[`OracleNewAddressResponse`](#oraclenewaddressresponse)**: When the enclave updates and moves to a new contract address, it responds with the updated address details.
