## Description

The TonTeeTon project seeks to enhance the capabilities of TON DApps by enabling trusted off-chain computations using secure memory enclaves.

By providing verifiable computation results and protecting sensitive data, TonTeeTon empowers developers to build sophisticated off-chain solutions while leveraging the benefits of the TON blockchain.

TonTeeTon off-chain applications (*enclaves*) are developed using the [EGo SDK](https://www.edgeless.systems/products/ego) by [Edgeless Systems](https://www.edgeless.systems/).

## TonTastic

TonTeeTon participated in the [Open League Summer: Belgrade Bootcamp](https://lu.ma/theopenleaguesummerbelgrade) track during the [ETHBelgrade Hackathon](https://ethbelgrade.rs/hackathon), earning 3rd place.

The TONtastic! Telegram bot and Mini-app were implemented, demonstrating a gamified quiz application utilizing the TonTeeTon oracle contract: [github.com/tonteeton/tontastic](https://github.com/tonteeton/tontastic)
